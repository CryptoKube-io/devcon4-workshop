## Abstract

Hosting your own Ethereum node may seem trivial or boring at first glance, yet many DApp developers relinquish this responsibility to a third-party service.

In this 2-hour workshop, learn how to conveniently host your own production-grade Ethereum node infrastructure. We leverage open source tools that were developed to build and maintain the infrastructure of real companies who depend on reliable and performant interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Primary Topics
  - Running a full node for reliable peering of light clients
  - High availability for load balancing and rolling upgrades
  - Techniques to achieve fast scalability and disaster recovery
  - Mitigating lesser-known deficiencies of popular clients (geth & parity)
  - Secure transaction signing

Participants will gain a customizable toolkit for future use, and the infrastructure built during the workshop can be saved for continued operation. It is also fine for additional the workshop or simply follow along for an educational experience.
